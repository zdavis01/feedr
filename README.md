# feedr
This is a single page app that pulls articles from selected apis and displays them in a single feed

I've managed to get through most of the requirements. Minus a few of the bonus requirements due to time restraints.

The project was interesting and challenging My biggest learning aside from fetching data from an API was becoming more comfortable 
with writing code - using components, understanding what it means to set state and how to set it properly, using promises etc

You can run this from your terminal by navigating to the project folder and using the command "npm start"

You can view the code from your terminal by navigationg to the project folder and using the command "atom ."

If you have any issues you may need to run "npm install" in the project directory and try again.

It's definatley a project I will contunue to improve and work on over time. I am aware that it will need a lot of refactoring.
